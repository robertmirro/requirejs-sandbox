        <h1>RequireJS - 5</h1>

        <ul>
			<li>data-main used to set baseUrl: <b>./app_5.js</b></li>
			<li>app_5.js <b>includes requirejs.config</b> to reset baseUrl to <b>"js/lib"</b>,
				set "app" path to <b>"../app"</b>, add <b>"jquery"</b> AND <b>underscore</b> to path and then
				<b>require(app/main_5.js)</b> and is returned a module reference. Can see both of these .js
				files loaded asyncronously via devtools network waterfall</li>
			<li><b>NOTE:</b> <u>had to include js/lib/underscore-min.map in order to allow Chrome to load source
				map for minified underscore.js</u> (the source map file was showing as not loading in the network
				waterfall because JS source maps are enabled in Chrome by default)</li>
			<li>app/main_5.js: use require() for dependency on jQuery [<i>why does "require" need to be
				passed to main_5.js inside of "define()" and what does "require()" need to be used to
				require jQuery as opposed to requirejs()?</i>], <b>define()</b> a module that returns
				an object, use jQuery to manipulate page</li>
        </ul>
